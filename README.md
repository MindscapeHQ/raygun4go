raygun4go adds Raygun-based error handling to your golang code. It catches all
occuring errors, extracts as much information as possible and sends the error
to Raygun via their REST-API.

## Getting Started

### Installation
```
  $ go get github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4go
```

### Basic Usage

Include the package and then defer the HandleError-method as soon as possible
in a context as global as possible. In webservers, this will probably be your
request handling method, in all other programs it should be your main-method.
It'll automatically capture any _panic_ and report it.
Having found the right spot, just add the following example code:

```
raygun, err := raygun4go.New("appName", "apiKey")
if err != nil {
  log.Println("Unable to create Raygun client:", err.Error())
}
defer raygun.HandleError()
```

where ``appName`` is the name of your app and ``apiKey`` is your
Raygun-API-key. If your program runs into a panic now (which you can easily
test by adding ``panic("foo")`` after the call to ``defer``), the handler will
send the error to Raygun.

#### Manually sending errors

To send errors manually you can use `CreateError(message string)`, or `SendError(error error)`. `CreateError` creates an
error and immediately reports it, `SendError` immediately reports the error.

```
if err := raygun.CreateError("something bad happened"); err != nil {
    log.Printf("failed to report error to Raygun: %v\n", err)
}
```

```
err := something.Do()
if err := raygun.SendError(err); err != nil {
    log.Printf("failed to report error to Raygun: %v\n", err)
}
```

### Options

The client returned by ``New`` has several chainable option-setting methods

Method                    | Description
--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
`Silent(bool)`            | If set to true, this prevents the handler from sending the error to Raygun, printing it instead.
`Request(*http.Request)`  | Adds the responsible http.Request to the error.
`Version(string)`         | If your program has a version, you can add it here.
`Tags([]string)`          | Adds the given tags to the error. These can be used for filtering later.
`CustomData(interface{})` | Add arbitrary custom data to you error. Will only reach Raygun if it works with `json.Marshal()`.
`User(string)`            | Add the name of the affected user to the error.

### Custom grouping

By default, the Raygun service will group errors together based on stacktrace content.
If you have any cases where you want to control the error grouping yourself, then you can provide
a custom-grouping-key callback function. Below is a simple example of this, that returns a hard-coded
grouping key, which would cause all errors to be grouped together:

`raygun.CustomGroupingKeyFunction(func(error, raygun4go.PostData)string{return "customGroupingKey"})`

The callback takes the original error, and the Raygun PostData payload structure that is about to be serialized and sent to Raygun.
In your callback, you can check these values to help build your own grouping key logic based on different cases that you want
to control. For any error you don't want to group yourself, return an empty string - Raygun will then use the default grouping.
